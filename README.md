# Latitude-Analysis-Site
Latitude analysis site for UCI's Data Analysis Boot Camp.

This site was built using basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and features plots and charts that compare city latitude to a number of various common weather phenomena.

The data provided for the included graphics was from a previous boot-camp assignment.  The original CSV was converted to a HTML table using a third-party website and can be viewed on the data page of this site.

Each page of this site is mobile-responsive using boiler-plate Boostrap components along with some additional custom CSS styling.
